# Create a Simple Inventory Website

This is the **first website** I created, using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This website functions as a **simple inventory**, where users can view a list of items and available stock, as well as perform operations such as adding, subtracting and borrowing items.

## Main Features
- âœ… **Item List View** â€“ Displays a list of products and stock.
- âœ… **Add, Subtract, and Borrow Items** â€“ Users can manage stock according to their needs by using JavaScript to update stock dynamically.
- âœ… **Responsive Design** â€“ Uses CSS for an attractive appearance on various devices.
- âœ… **Stock Storage in localStorage** â€“ Saves stock data in the user's browser so that stock changes remain after the page is refreshed.
- âœ… **JavaScript** â€“ For dynamic interaction with stock items, such as adding, subtracting and borrowing items.

## Technology Used
- **HTML** â€“ Web page structure.
- **CSS** â€“ Styling for an attractive appearance.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Logic for managing stock items dynamically.
- **localStorage** â€“ Stores stock data in the browser.

## The final result

This project is my first step in building a website with **HTML, CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I use **localStorage** to store stock data so that it can be maintained even if the page is refreshed. Interactive features using **JavaScript** allow users to manage stock items more easily.

In the future, I plan to add more dynamic features and UI optimization to make it more interactive.

Thanks for reading! ðŸš€
